LEGO, a robust collection of plastic construction toys manufactured by the LEGO Group, is a great target to study for a computer vision machine learning project. It's natural for the Lego fans like us to ask: if we toss a bunch of Lego pieces on to the ground and took a photo, will the computer be able to recognize each piece captured? Our project seeks to dig deep into this question using object detection model.
