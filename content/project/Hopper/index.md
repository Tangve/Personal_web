summary = """
Using mechanical design inspired by the [Ghost Minitaur](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/robots/ghost-minitaur/) and the open-source motor controller hardware from the [Stanford Doggo](https://github.com/Nate711/StanfordDoggoProject), we built an open-source two-degree-of-freedom hopping robot. The robot hops using a Raibert-inspired reactive controller on the leg length and velocity.
