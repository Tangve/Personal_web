summary = """
Assembly a F1/10 car and utilized C++ via ROS to code different algorithm to make car perform different behaviors.<br> 
 1). Utilized simple PD controller to complete wall following.<br>
 2). Applied reactive method: follow the gap to achieve run a lap without hitting obstacles.<br>
 3). Utilized SLAM to locate car then ran car with Pure Pursuit as global planner and RRT* as local planner.
