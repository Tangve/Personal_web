summary = """
Our system learns from action-observation sequences collected through interaction, such as robotic manipulation or autonomous vehicle data, as well as observations of another demonstrator agent, such as data from a human or a dashboard camera. By combining interaction and observation data, our model is able to learn to generate predictions for complex tasks and new environments without costly expert demonstrations.
