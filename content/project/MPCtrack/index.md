summary = """
In our project, the cart is running from a predefined source point to a destination point on a map with some fixed x and y boundaries. On the map we generate some randomly distributed obstacles with random sizes and shapes unknown to the cart. When the cart “detects” the obstacle, it will follow the path we planned to avoid collision.
